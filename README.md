### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jorge Garcia, a software engineer with experience working on SaaS products.

What motivates me is building great software and help my company to improve and grow.

My work includes: implementing continuous refactoring, tackle technical debt, implement agile processes, advocate for clean and well tested
code, collaborate with stakeholders, establish quality standards and develop greenfield and maintain brownfield projects.

Keep improving my work is my drive; I seek new ways to perfect my code, support my teammates, and learn from them.

I firmly believe in building [high-quality software](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html) within reasonable schedules without burning out the team.
