### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jorge Garcia, a backend (rails) developer with experience working on SaaS products.

I'm an advocate of clean code, continuous refactoring, following guidelines, and improving the codebase.

Keep improving my work is my drive;  I seek new ways to perfect my code, support my teammates, and learn from them.

I have experience in multiple areas of SaaS products, such as:
Designing new features on green/brown projects, migrating data, optimizing endpoints, identifying bottlenecks, and addressing security issues.

On the other side, I have assisted on the continuous improvement of the hiring process, worked closely with product managers, and mentoring jr devs

I firmly believe in building [high-quality software](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html) within reasonable schedules without burning out the team.
